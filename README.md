This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Note

The goal of this project was to explore the integration of artificial intelligence into the front end by building a chatbot. Additionally, I experimented with advanced functionalities such as file uploads and AI-generated reply suggestions, which required thoughtful implementation and deeper integration. The front-end styling and certain UX elements remain in a prototype stage, as the primary focus was on AI integration and functionality.

## Getting Started
First you need to create a .env.local file that holds your API key. In my case it was 

OPENAI_API_KEY:"api-key here"

Then, to get dependencies:

```bash
npm install 
```

Then to run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
